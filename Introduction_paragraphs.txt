The state of California both experiences and conducts extensive policy making towards landslides. Notably, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) conducts research on landslide triggers throughout the Bay Area and throughout California. This includes monitoring the effects of winter storms on landslides and the analysis of soil moisture conditions. Other extraneous factors have been indicated as causes of landslides. For instance, winter storms have a general historical trend of significant damage resulting in large scale property damage and casualties. For instance, a winter storm in 1982 led to large scale effects in the San Francisco bay region. In addition to winter storms, areas affected by forest fires are also indicative of shallow landslides, as demonstrated through the Kincade fire in Sonoma County and the Briceburg fire in Mariposa County in 2019. Coastal erosion, most notable during El Ni√±o events due to high wave energy, lead to coastal landslides which can be exacerbated by rainfall. High wave activity, both during and post-storm, can result in rapid erosion proportionate to overall soil strength. Rainfall can act as a cause of failure to lead to an erosion event - even independent of wave action in some cases.
